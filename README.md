## OBJECTIVE :-

The main aim and target for that matter of our project is to save and enhance the life of FARMERS. It acts as an interface medium between the farmers and the buyers. The buyer can locate all the near by farmers and catagorise the crops which the  farmer is selling. And the farmer as well can see the near by buyers to have a trade with them. 
             
 Let's understand the working of our project with a real world example. The price of tomato in Chennai is around 35 to 40 Ruppees. But if we ask the farmer, he might claim that he sold it for less than 10 Rupees. So the price difference is something around 25 to 30 Rupees.  So, by using our project, the farmer sell his crops at 15 Rupees (say for example) which will make the farmer happy (because he is now selling it at more than 6 to 7 Rupees as compared to the previous price) and also the buyer happy (because he is now buying it at less than 20 to 25 Rupees as compared to the previous price). 
             
  So by using our project the problem of 'Increasing Price' of crops can be sorted due to which the farmers can get a huge amount of margin profit out of it and can also decrease the farmer's death rate. 
                
  LET'S MAKE USE OF IT WISELY AND MORE THAN THAT!
